## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

The hardest part for me was not the card but the two background images. It took me a while to get them right. The card layout was easy in comparison for me.

### Continued development

I still need to work on improving my application of flexbox and grid layouts. As well as a better understanding of position relative and position absolute.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank Kevin Powell and codeSTACKr for their help and inspiration on my front end development journey.
